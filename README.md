# Project on Simulating Active Brownian Particles
This GitHub repository is a research project with Dr. Cristina Marchetti and Dr. Silke Henkes on Active Brownian Particles (ABP).

## Physics of Active Brownian Particles

To learn about the physics of ABPs, please see the paper "Minimal Model of Active Colloids Highlights to Role of Mechanical Interactions in Controlling the Emergent Behavior of Active Matter"

## Installation
Begin by following the installation guide in ryanlopezzzz/ABPTutorial, and make sure to install the cppmd module. Then clone this repository, open ABP_Simulation.ipynb, change the necessary directories and run.
